## Game Flow

1. **Create Game**: Player clicks "Start New Game"
   - Server selects random position from `interesting-positions.json`
   - Server assigns random color to host
   - Server generates unique game ID and returns game URL

2. **Join Game**: Friend clicks the shared link
   - Client connects to game via WebSocket
   - Server assigns opposite color to guest
   - Game becomes active when both players connected

3. **Play Game**: Players take turns making moves
   - Moves validated using chess.js
   - Game state synchronized in real-time via WebSocket
   - Visual feedback for whose turn it is
